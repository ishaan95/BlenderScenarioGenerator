# Blender Scenario Generator

Blender-based tool for creating simulation scenarios for testing autonomous vehicles. This is a fork of blender-driving-scenario-creator Blender add-on tool. Please refer to the [original repository](https://github.com/johschmitz/blender-driving-scenario-creator) for installation instructions.

## Outputs
This tool generates maps in OpenDRIVE and 3D file formats such as FBX. It can also generate scenarios in the OpenSCENARIO format. 

## Developer guidelines
1. The original files are left as-is to allow for changes from the community. We can regularly sync any changes from the fork connection. If this project deviates significantly, we can remove the fork connection.  
2. New files made in this project are given the prefix 'bsg_' in the filename.

## Export to CARLA
Please refer to the process [detailed here](https://github.com/johschmitz/blender-driving-scenario-creator/issues/23).
